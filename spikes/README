This contains spikes made during the developement of the Quad Solver. It has the following spikes;
One that finds the floating point epsilon for this machine.
One that computes various floating point numbers.
One that parses numerical input through sscanf().
One that takes input from scanf().
One that demonstrates opening multiple shells vs using a single shell sequentially with a make script.

You can run the spike programs with the following commands;

$ make whateps ---compiles and runs spike to find machine epsilon.
$ make inputSpike---compiles and runs input spike.
$ make parse--- compiles and runs the input parsing spike.
$ make floating--- compiles and runs the floating point spkie.
$ make makeSpike--- demonstrates opening multiple shells using a single shell sequentially
$ make all --- compiles and runs all spikes
